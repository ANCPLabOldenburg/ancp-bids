# About
ancpBIDS is a lightweight Python library to read/query/validate/write BIDS datasets.
It can be used in workflows or analysis pipelines to handle IO specific aspects without bothering much about low level file system operations.
Its implementation is based on the BIDS schema and allows it to evolve with the BIDS specification in a generic way.
Using a plugin mechanism, contributors can extend its functionality in a controlled and clean manner.
