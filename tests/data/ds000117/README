    ==================================================================================

Please note that the subject ordering has changed since version 0.1.x (non-BIDS) of this 
dataset. Additionally, three subjects have been left out. The mapping is as follows:
0.1.x:   02 03 05 14 08 09 10 11 12 15 16 17 18 23 24 25
current: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

func/
-----
The experiment began at the third nifti volume (corresponding to 5 ignored scans: 3 forced siemens dummies (no files) and 2 included in the data).

meg/
----
Three anatomical fiducials were digitized for aligning the MEG with the MRI: the nasion 
(lowest depression between the eyes) and the left and right ears (lowest depression 
between the tragus and the helix, above the tragus). This procedure is illustrated here:
http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/CoordinateSystems#Subject_Coordinate_System_.28SCS_.2F_CTF.29
and in task-facerecognition_fidinfo.pdf 

The following triggers are included in the .fif files and are also used in the “trigger” column of the meg and bold events files:

Trigger            Label               Simplified Label

5         Initial Famous Face               FAMOUS
6         Immediate Repeat Famous Face      FAMOUS
7         Delayed Repeat Famous Face        FAMOUS
13        Initial Unfamiliar Face           UNFAMILIAR
14        Immediate Repeat Unfamiliar Face  UNFAMILIAR
15        Delayed Repeat Unfamiliar Face    UNFAMILIAR
17        Initial Scrambled Face            SCRAMBLED
18        Immediate Repeat Scrambled Face   SCRAMBLED
19        Delayed Repeat Scrambled Face     SCRAMBLED
