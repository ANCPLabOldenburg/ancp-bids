    "TaskDescription": "After the M/EEG acquisition, participants saw each of the 300 faces again, but now used three buttons to indicate whether (1) they had not seen the face before the experiment, (2) the face looked familiar, but they could not remember from where, or (3) they knew the face, i.e. could remember definite fact about them, such as their job, a movie they were in, their name etc. On average across participants, 73% of famous faces were given a rating of 2-3, and 86% of nonfamous faces were given a rating of 1. These debriefing data could be used to further refine familiarity of each participant with each face, and are available on request, but were not used in the current validation."
